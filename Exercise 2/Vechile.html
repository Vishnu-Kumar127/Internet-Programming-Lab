&quot; As you walk down the road, you happen to see a vehicle hitting a cyclist and speeding off without stopping. You manage to note down the vehicle registration number, but you do not know how to find the details of both the vehicle and the driver. You go to the Regional Transport Office and ultimately get hold of the required information after a long struggle and wasting a lot of your precious time. Actually, there are better ways to find out vehicle details by number plate.

     <div>Finding Vehicle Owner Details by Number Plate on the VAHAN Website
 In 2011, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways collaborated with the National Informatics Centre to launch the national vehicle registry, VAHAN. According to the website, it consists of data related to more than 250,000,000 motor vehicles such as bikes, cars, auto-rickshaws, buses, and cabs registered in India. The objective behind launching the VAHAN website was to collate the details of driving licenses and vehicle registration details recorded by the District Transport Offices and Regional Transport Offices across the country.</div>

 

<div>That is it! You will be able to see all the details related to your car or bike provided at the time of registering with the local RTO displayed on the screen.</div>

<div> VAHAN collates and produces information about vehicles and owners in all states and Union Territories in India. These details comply with the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. On entering the registration number of your vehicle, you can get the following details from the VAHAN website:</div>

<div>Different Scenarios When You Need to Check the Vehicle Owner Name by Registration Number
If traffic police stop you and you do not have your vehicle’s documents with you, then you may have to pay a heavy fine. This was true in the past, but not any longer. You can put this worry to rest. You are not required to carry with you the hard copy of your vehicle’s documents all the time. You can save the documents digitally and show them to the traffic police on demand. The details you save in DigiLockers will be considered legitimate across India. However, the traffic enforcement authorities might want to verify the details you provide with the VAHAN website to ensure their legitimacy.</div>

<div>In the past, you had to acquire a no-objection certificate, or NOC, for your vehicle if you moved to another state or UT for more than a year. The popularization of the VAHAN website has done away with the need to carry a NOC for your vehicle. This is because RTOs across the country can access the data available on the VAHAN site.</div>
