	<div>A petrol vehicle typically uses a spark-ignited internal combustion engine. In a spark-ignited system, the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber and combined with air. The air/fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from the spark plug. Petrol cars are available in either manual and automatic transmission.

	<div>Petrol cars are the second most popular new car choice for Irish motorists, with their market share currently at 38% in the new car market, which has been increasing in recent years.</div>

    While CO2 emissions from petrol tend to be higher than an equivalent diesel vehicle, they are better from an air quality (NOx) perspective. Fuel costs, due to both higher fuel duties and fuel efficiency, tend to be higher when compared to a diesel equivalent, but servicing costs are lower. The petrol car is perfectly suited to urban driving and commuting journeys. It has lower NOx emissions than diesel cars meaning improved air quality. Petrol cars have lighter engines with quicker responsiveness. </div>
    <div><h2 style="text-align:center;">Top 2 Types of Vehicle Fuels Used in India</h2>
		Here is a brief overview of 2 different types of fuels used in vehicles. Have a look!
		<ol>
<li><h3>Petrol</h3></li>
Petrol, also known as gasoline, is one of the most common fuel types for a vehicle. It is transparent and is derived via the fractional distillation of petroleum.  It is used in spark-ignited combustion engines and is available in multiple variants. 

<div>Let's take a look at its pros and cons â€“</div>

<h3>Pros</h3>
<ol>
	<li>It is cost-effective.</li>
	<li>Provides optimum acceleration.</li>
	<li>Petrol stations are easily available.</li>
	<li>Suitable for all types of ranges.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cons</h3>

<ol>
	<li>This fuel emits a high level of toxic gases.</li>
	<li>It offers lower mileage than diesel.</li>
	<li>Ideal for: 4-wheeler private cars, bikes</li>
</ol>

Price per litre: It is important to remember that the cost of gasoline differs in each state. Here is the table comprising the respective petrol prices in different Indian cities

	<li><h3>Diesel</h3></li></ol>
Despite the current scenario, diesel consumption witnessed recovery with a 27% rise. This speaks volumes about the popularity of this fuel. Like petrol, diesel is also obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum oil that is specially tailored for a diesel engine.

<h3>Pro</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Offers value-for-money and is efficient for long travels.</li>
	<li>Features high torque and delivers excellent performance on express lane.</li>
	<li>It offers enhanced acceleration.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Diesel engines require high maintenance and hence incur whopping expenses.</li>
	<li>A diesel engine does not cater to every make and model.</li>
	<li>Ideal for: Trucks, trains, public buses</li>
</ol>
Price per litre:  Like petrol, diesel prices differ in each state. Here is a table for your reference
